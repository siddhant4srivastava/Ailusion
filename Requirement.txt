# AI/ML Intern Task: Synthetic Image Generation, Preprocessing & Flux Model

Short Description of My Approach for Each Part of the Task
1. Synthetic Image Generation
I utilized Stable Diffusion from the diffusers library to generate images based on a text prompt.
I chose a creative prompt: "A serene sunset over a futuristic city."
I generated three images and saved them with descriptive filenames.
If GPU constraints were encountered, pre-generated images could serve as a substitute.

2. Image Preprocessing
I loaded the generated images using PIL (Pillow) and processed them with Torchvision.
I resized the images to 224Ã—224 pixels to ensure consistency.
I converted the images into normalized tensors (with values scaled between 0 and 1).
Optionally, I converted the images to grayscale for simplified input.
I saved and displayed the preprocessed images for verification.

3. Minimal Flux Model: Forward Pass Demonstration

Note: I did not execute this part due to my limited knowledge of Julia.

7. Documentation & Submission
I organized all scripts (image_generation.py, preprocessing.py, flux_forward_pass.jl).
I created a structured README.md explaining the setup, execution, and challenges I faced.
I stored the generated and preprocessed images in an image/ folder.
